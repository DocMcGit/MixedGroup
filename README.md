# MixedGroup

A MixedGroup is an ordered set (implemented as an Array) that holds two kinds of elements:

Element (MixedGroup is generic over Element)
Subgroup (Another MixedGroup, generic over the same Element type)

MixedGroupBuilder is a Result Builder (@_functionBuilder in Swift 5.2-5.3) that builds a MixedGroup via a DSL much like SwiftUI.

##

MixedGroup back the data sets described in the Swift libraries *Piddy* (a Podcast directory), *Collegiate* (a University directory), and *Wavy* (a radio station directory).
